                        <h4>Kanye West</h4>
                        <p>Kanye West first approached Murakami in 2007 about working with him. Three months after a meeting in the artist’s studio, Murakami got the call that West wanted an album design for his third album, Graduation. The cover art depicts an animated bear version of West in space, expressing colorful, pastel imagery synonymous with Murakami’s style. He also directed the music video for the opening track “Good Morning”, which was shot using the characters he created.</p>

                        <h4>Bille Eilish</h4>
                        <p>Murakami and Eilish's collaboration began with “Doraemon UT,” a collection created by Murakami released in Spring/Summer 2018. This UT line featured T-shirts with art exhibited by Murakami the previous year at THE DORAEMON EXHIBITION TOKYO 2017. Murakami’s characteristic floral motifs, and collages with the main characters Doraemon and other characters, covered the blue portions of Doraemon’s head and body. The artistic representation of such an iconic national character caused a stir in Japan that reverberated around the world. Based on this collaboration, we knew that we wanted to work with Murakami again one day. Just at that moment, Murakami produced a music video for a female artist.</p>

                        <h4>Virgil Abloh</h4>
                        <p>Takashi Murakami and Virgil Abloh shared a dynamic creative partnership that blended contemporary art and fashion. Their collaboration began in 2018, driven by mutual admiration for each other's work. Murakami, known for his vibrant, anime-inspired aesthetic, and Abloh, the visionary founder of Off-White and artistic director of Louis Vuitton, combined their talents to create unique pieces that blurred the lines between high art and streetwear. Their projects included joint exhibitions, such as "Future History," and limited-edition merchandise that integrated Murakami's iconic flower motifs with Abloh's deconstructive design approach. Together, they pushed cultural boundaries, making art and fashion accessible to a broader audience.</p>

                        <h4>Louis Vuitton</h4>
                        <p>This collaboration came about in 2003 when Marc Jacobs, creative director of Louis Vuitton at the time, invited Murakami to makeover a collection with his distinctive pop-colored palette. He partnered with the luxury brand to introduce some brightness and a new sense of style, as it traditionally leaned towards black and brown. Murakami’s LV bags were made with injections of hot pink, turquoise, yellow and Kelly green.
                        The initial Murakami collection launched in Spring/Summer 2003 and became an instant hit within the industry and with its customers, infiltrating the world of pop culture as it appeared on the arms of celebrities like Jessica Simpson, Ashley Tisdale, and Naomi Campbell. The collection has been deemed “The Defining Fashion Collaboration of The Noughties” by Vogue.
