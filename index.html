        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Ayah Abdelhameed. I am a third-year Communication Design student, and I'm minoring in HCI and Creative Practice for Social Change!</li>
            <li>I've always been interested in the intersection of design and technology. I've taken one HTML class before, but I've forgotten most of it so I wanted the reminder of how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li>I've taken a couple of classes that have covered HTML, CSS, and JS, but I've never really gone in depth learning how to use them.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to actually make websites that look good rather than just the design for them.</li>
            <li>I think it will be a lot more minor tweaks than overall design changes.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is designed very well in my opinion. It's very clear how to use it, and it effectively uses all of the sapce on the screen without being too cluttered.</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.wix.com"target="_blank"> Wix</a> is very straightforward in its design. I doesn't present the viewer with too much information, only what they need to know.</li>
            <li><a href="https://ollivere.co/"target="_blank">This</a> website I just think looks very cool. It has a ton of different elements that can be used for inspiration when designing a fun website.</li>
