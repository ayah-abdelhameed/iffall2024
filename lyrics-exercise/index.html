        <p style="font-style: italic;">[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>Who's been out here? Hold your hand up </p>
        <p>I could call it even if you never stand up</p>
        <p>Two more blank eyes lookin' through me</p>
        <p>Thinkin' of a place from where you maybe knew me</p>
       
        <br>

        <p>Been in search of new sensations</p>
        <p>Now I'm just looking for some communication</p>
        <p>Is there ever a simple answer?</p>
        <p>She's a model, she's an actress, she's a dance</p>

        <br>

        <p>If the mood's right, we'll talk all night</p>
        <p>It might be a road to nowhere, but it's alright</p>
        <p>It might help me not feel empty</p>
        <p>Have you learnеd something about me once you'vе left me?</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>What's the motive? What's the reason?</p>
        <p>What's the right or wrong occasion for an evening?</p>
        <p>I'm just craving a connection</p>
        <p>Can you tell that I'm nervous just by my complexion?</p>
        
        <br> 

        <p>Guess I'm gaining some momentum</p>
        <p>Yeah, we've got a little tension and it's pent up</p>
        <p>It means nothing, but I know one thing</p>
        <p>I'll keep running until I crash into something</p>

        <br>

        <p>There's people knockin' at my door</p>
        <p>Don't know if I can let 'em in</p>
        <p>I need to be alone, not be taken away</p>
        <p>I thought that I owed myself all this time</p>

        <br>

        <p>I don't want to be forgotten</p>
        <p>But I've been avoiding being found</p>
        <p>Maybe what I owe myself is an open heart</p>
        <p>To someone I wanna keep around</p>

        <br>

        <p>Arms are reaching, eyes are open</p>
        <p>It's my first time doing this, so here's to hopin'</p>
        <p>She's a wonder, a sensation</p>
        <p>She's like a figment of my imagination</p>

        <br>

        <p>Do your words hold hidden meaning?</p>
        <p>Hold your gaze on me and I feel like I'm dreaming</p>
        <p>I looked up to you above me</p>
        <p>Said it's difficult to not say that you love me</p>

        <br>

        <p>And if you're ever at my door</p>
        <p>You know I'll always let you in</p>
        <p>I'm no longer afraid of being taken away</p>
        <p>So give me your hand and I'll give you mine</p>

        <br>

        <p>I want to keep up with you</p>
        <p>So could you tell me what you think feels good?</p>
        <p>And if you want it, lovely girl, then you got it</p>
        <p>I'll make you scream about it like you should</p>
